## Caption Tool
################################################################################

# Hello! This is Caption Tool, a simple tool for adding image and sound captions to your Ren'Py game, made by npckc (https://npckc.site)!

# Lines that begin with TODO: are sections where you may be required to do something with the code, so you can Ctrl+F TODO: to make sure you haven't missed anything.

# TODO: Please copy this file (captiontool.rpy) to the "game" folder of your game. As well, please add the following textbutton to a screen somewhere, like the Preferences screen in your screens.rpy file.

# textbutton _("Accessibility") action ShowMenu("accessibility")
# TODO: Remove the # when pasting in the preferences screen. You can also use the code in the screens.rpy file of this tool instead.

# Once you've done that, you're OK! Just edit captiontool.rpy to work with your game (e.g., add your own sound captions, change the image caption character name if necessary).

# You can take a look at script.rpy for an example of the code.

# If you use this tool, I would appreciate it if you can credit npckc (https://npckc.site or https://npckc.itch.io) or the tool in some way, but it isn't required.

# This is the sound command. It functions the same way as "play sound" normally does. You can change the fadein, fadeout and loop values when you invoke the command. If you do not change the values, the default values are 0.0 fadein, 0.0 fadeout, and no loop. If you change the values below, that will change the default values for every time you invoke the command.

# Add additional values afterwards if you want to change them from the default.
#(Remove the # when using it.)

# $ play_sound(beepbeep)
# $ play_sound(phone, loop=True)

# You can use "stop sound" to stop the sound, just as you would normally.

# This is the music command. It functions the same way as "play music" normally does. You can change the fadein and fadeout values when you invoke the command. If you do not change the values, the default values are 0.0 fadein and 0.0 fadeout. If you change the values below, that will change the default values for every time you invoke the command.

# $ play_music(cake)

# You can use "stop music" to stop the sound, just as you would normally.

# Note: By default, the play_sound command will play on the sound channel, and the play_music command will play on the music channel, but if you have custom channels, you can specify the channel in your command.

# Example:
# $ play_sound(ambientsound, channel='ambient')
# $ play_music(rainybgm, channel='weathermusic')

## C3: Image Captions
################################################################################

# This character will speak if image captions or self-voicing is on. Ren'Py also has "alt" (or "sv" in previous versions of Ren'Py), a built-in character that can be used for self-voicing, but the following character, "ic", will be displayed even if self-voicing if off as long as image captions are set to On in Preferences. The default character name is None - that is, there is no name, like a narrator - but that can be changed.

define ic = Character(_(None),condition="persistent.image_captions or _preferences.self_voicing")

# You can read more about Ren'Py's built-in self-voicing options here: https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/self_voicing.html

################################################################################
## C4: Accessibility Menu
################################################################################

# This can be used if you want a menu ONLY for accessibility options. You can also copy and paste the buttons into the default Ren'Py preferences screen.

# screen accessibility():

#     tag menu

#     use game_menu(_("Preferences"), scroll="viewport"):
#         vbox:
#             style_prefix "check"
#             label _("Accessibility")
#             textbutton _("Sound Captions") action ToggleVariable("persistent.sound_captions")
#             textbutton _("Image Captions") action ToggleVariable("persistent.image_captions")
#             # Self-voicing does not work on smartphone devices, so this option only shows if the user is playing on a PC.
#             if renpy.variant("pc"):
#                 textbutton _("Self-Voicing") action Preference("self voicing", "toggle")
#             # This shows Ren'Py's built-in accessibility menu, added to Ren'Py in Ren'Py 7.2.2. This can also be displayed by pressing "A" on the keyboard when playing on a PC. As this option can break the way the game is displayed and also does not support translation as of Ren'Py build 7.3.2, you may want to hide the option. The button should also be removed if your version of Ren'Py is under 7.2.2, as the menu does not exist in previous versions.
#             textbutton _("More Options...") action Show("_accessibility")
#             textbutton ("") #Adds space between accessibility options and return button
#             # The Return button will return the user to the Preferences menu. It can be removed if it isn't necessary.

#             textbutton _("Return") action ShowMenu("preferences")

## C5: Initialising Sound Captions for Translations
################################################################################

# If you are translating your game, adding the following will make sure that sound captions are properly initialised when starting a new game or loading a save file.

# TODO: Add this to the beginning of your start label:

# $ renpy.change_language(_preferences.language, force=True)
# Remove the # when copying and pasting.

# You can see an example in script.rpy.

# TODO: If you are using the Ren'Py after_load label elsewhere, you can just include the code from here into your label

# label after_load:

#     $ renpy.change_language(_preferences.language, force=True)

#     return

# Please refer to script.rpy for an example of how to translate sound captions for a different language.
